*This page assumes you are comfortable with [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), [Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), and [NPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)). You must have all of these installed on your machine.*

### WordWeaver

1. First, clone the WordWeaver repository: ```git clone https://github.com/roedoejet/wordweaver```
2. To install WordWeaver: `cd wordweaver && npm install`

You're now ready to go on to adapting the code to [create your own WordWeaver](ww-ui-customization.md)!

:::tip
If everything has worked properly after following the steps above, you should be able to then run `npm start`. This will build the site using the development configuration and you should now be able to go to `localhost:4200` and view your instance of WordWeaver.
