*This guide assumes you have followed the steps of both [installing](ww-installation.md) and [setting up](ww-firststeps.md) WordWeaver. You are therefore assumed to have some knowledge and understanding of [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), [Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)). In order to deploy to a production environment, it's also recommended that you have some familiarity with [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/). All of these tools are used in this guide*

## The basic layout

Before we dig in, have a look at the directory tree below. Please refer to it throughout this guide.

:::note
If there are files in your cloned version that are not in the tree below, you do not have to worry about them unless you are very comfortable with Python and Docker and want to customize your application beyond what is covered in this documentation.

```

When deploying just to a development environment (the default) there is only one service being composed by docker, the [backend](#backend-wordweaver). To deploy to production, we also need a [certbot](#certbot) service and a [reverse proxy](#reverse-proxy-nginx).

## Backend (WordWeaver)

This is the main configurable service. It is the `wordweaver` Python package and API.

Every WordWeaver has its data separated into 4 main sections: [Verbs](#verbs), [Pronouns](#pronouns), [Options](#options), and [Conjugations](#conjugations). This data must be in JSON format. To add your data, create a new folder in `src/wordweaver/data` named after your languages’s [ISO 639-3 code](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data). You will need to add 6 files: the described JSON data files, a blank \_\_init\_\_.py file, and a [models](#models) file. The following sections describe the data and models files.

In order for your data to be used when ran, you must change the variable WWLANG in the file `src/env-backend.env` to your languages’s [ISO 639-3 code](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data). For example, to use the french data, it must read as follows:
 
       `WWLANG=fr`


__Note__: There is a default folder included in the initial downloaded, called `src/wordweaver/data/yourlang`. This folder contains the default models.py file (exactly as described below) and an empty \_\_init\_\_.py file. You may also instead rename this folder after your languages’s ISO 639-3 code and add your JSON data files there.

__Note__: There is a french wordweaver included in the initial downloaded, called `src/wordweaver/data/fr`. Feel free to explore this folder for reference or to copy code.

## Language Data
First, we will describe the data structures and files you will need to build. 

### Verbs

You must have data related to the verb roots available in your WordWeaver in a `verbs.json` file. Your verbs should be a JSON array of objects. Minimally, each verb in your verbs array **must** have a unique`tag` and a `classes` key. 

#### tag

The `tag` is the unique identifier for that verb. It must also be URL friendly, otherwise known as a [slug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19335215/what-is-a-slug). To be URL friendly, a slug must be restricted to [certain characters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1547899/which-characters-make-a-url-invalid)

#### classes

The `classes` key is an array of strings that are CSS class names to apply to that verb. This can be used to distinguish different verb types to the user. For more information, please visit the [WordWeaver UI style customization guide](ww-ui-style#custom-css).

Default Definition:

```python
class Verb(BaseModel):
    ''' Required '''
    tag: str = ''
    classes: List[str] = []
```  
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/models.py`</sub>

For example, the verbs JSON file should be of the following form:

```json
[
   {
       "tag":"aller",
       "en": 
            {
                 "tag": "go"
            },
   }
]
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/verbs.json`</sub>


### Pronouns

You must have data related to pronouns available in your WordWeaver in a `pronouns.json` file. Your pronouns should be a JSON array of objects. Minimally, each pronoun in your pronoun array **must** have a unique`tag` and the JSON file must include both the `tag` and a display form (i.e. what the user will see). The default for the pronouns is to accept only a `subject`. To include an `object`, it should be included in the pronouns JSON file and the [Conjugations](#conjugations) related models must be updated as well (see section for details).

#### tag

The `tag` is the unique identifier for that pronoun. It must also be URL friendly, otherwise known as a [slug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19335215/what-is-a-slug). To be URL friendly, a slug must be restricted to [certain characters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1547899/which-characters-make-a-url-invalid)

Default Definition:

```python
class Pronoun(BaseModel):
    ''' Required '''
    tag: str = ''
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/models.py`</sub>
 
 
For example, the pronouns JSON file should be of the following form:

```json
[
   {
       "tag":"1SG",
       "en": 
            {
                 "subject": "I"
            },
   }
]
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/pronouns.json`</sub>

### Options

The 'Options' category is a catch-all category for all other types of information associated with choosing a conjugation. You must have data related to the options available in your WordWeaver in a single `options.json` file. Your options should be a JSON array of objects. Minimally, each option in your options array **must** have a unique`tag`. The JSON file must the unique `tag` and a display form (i.e. what the user will see). The default model also includes an optional `type` attribute.

#### tag

The `tag` is the unique identifier for that option. It must also be URL friendly, otherwise known as a [slug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19335215/what-is-a-slug). To be URL friendly, a slug must be restricted to [certain characters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1547899/which-characters-make-a-url-invalid).

#### type

The `type` allows for categorization of options (ex. tense, aspect etc)

Default Definition:

```python
class Option(BaseModel):
    ''' Required '''
    tag: str = ''
    type: str = ''
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/models.py`</sub>
 
 For example, the options JSON file should be of the following form:

```json
[
   {
       "tag": "indicatif-present",
       "type": "indicatif",
       "en": 
            {
                 "type": "Indicative"
            },
   }
]
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/options.json`</sub>


### Conjugations

You must have data related to the conjugations available in your WordWeaver in a single `conjugations.json`.

Each conjugation consists of an `input` and an `output`:

```python
class ResponseObject(BaseModel):
    input: ConjugationInput
    output: Conjugation
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/models.py`</sub>

The `input` is an object that includes the tag values for each related `verb`, `pronoun`, and `option`. __Note__ that the default ConjugationInput class assumes _only_ a subject is required for any given conjugation. If your language's conjugations may require an `object`, please be sure to add an `object` attribute to this model. 

```python
class ConjugationInput(BaseModel):
    root: str
    option: str
    subject: str
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/models.py`</sub>


The `output` is a list of objects containing response morphemes:

```python
Conjugation = List[ResponseMorpheme]
```

```python
class ResponseMorpheme(BaseModel):
    position: Optional[int]
    value: Optional[str]
    gloss: Optional[str]
    english: Optional[str]
    type: Optional[List[str]]
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/models.py`</sub>

Response morphemes are units that can be concatenated into `Tiers`. Tiers are [defined in the WordWeaver UI](#ww-ui-customization#tiers).

For example, the conjugations JSON file should be of the following form:

```json
{
    "input": {
        "root": "courir",
        "option": "indicatif-present",
        "subject": "2-pl"
    },
    "output": [
        {
            "position": 0,
            "value": "cour",
            "type": [
                "root"
            ]
        },
        {
            "position": 1,
            "value": "ez",
            "type": [
                "ending"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/conjugations.json`</sub>

Here, `courir` must be a tag of a verb defined in `verbs.json`. `indicatif-present` must be a tag of an option defined in `options.json` and `2-pl` must be a tag of a pronoun defined in `pronouns.json`.

If your language data is not available split up into morphemes, instead put the full value in position 0. 

### Models

Your models.py file is found at `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/models.py` and should contain a model for each data file ([Verbs](#verbs), [Pronouns](#pronouns), [Options](#options), and [Conjugations](#conjugations)). If your data does vary from the default that’s been described, you will have to update the associated model.

For example, if you wanted to include  a "gender" attribute to your "pronoun" data, you would have to up the pronoun model as follows

```typescript {2}
class Pronoun(BaseModel):
   ''' Required '''
   gender: str = ''
   tag: str = ''
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/models.py`</sub>

If your data does not vary from the described defaults, the included default models.py file will contain all sufficient information and can be left untouched.

### Internationalization - Including Other Languages

The current front end in it's entirety is translated available in both English and French. To include translations for the entire website in another language, see [Internationalization] (link).

Note that for all JSON files described in this section, the default display forms are expected in english. To include display forms in other languages, at this step you should similarily include those translations under the languages’s ISO 639-3 code. For example, if you wanted to include French display forms for your data, your pronouns should look as follows: 

```json
[
   {
       "tag":"1SG",
       "en": 
            {
                 "subject": "I"
            },
       "fr": 
            {
                 "subject": "Je"
            }
   }
]
```
<sub>Source: `src/wordweaver/data/<yourlang>/pronouns.json`</sub>

## Edit CORS rules

[Cross-origin resource sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (CORS) rules are defined in `src/wordweaver/main.py`. You can edit allowable [origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy#:~:text=An%20origin%20is%20defined%20as,that%20page's%20Document%20Object%20Model.), [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) and [headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) here.

This is a security feature that is intended to make sure that your wordweaver only loads resources (code and scripts) from trusted domains.

## Default available routes

WordWeaver creates an [API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) using your data and exposes it using the following default routes: `options`, `pronouns`, `verbs`, and `conjugations`. All of these routes are prefixed by `/api/v1` by default as well as the chosen domain. By default, if you run the development version, this is `localhost`. So, once WordWeaver is started, all of your pronouns are available at `localhost/api/v1/pronouns`.

Documentation for this API is automatically generated using the type definitions you set in your [models](#models) file. This is available at the `/docs` route, so assuming a development instance of WordWeaver, you could find your documentation at `localhost/docs` as seen below:

<img alt="create release" src={useBaseUrl('img/api.png')} />

## Reverse Proxy (nginx)

*This is only required for deploying to production environments*

The default [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) configuration is very basic. It is configured to work with your [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certification, and it is also configured to force redirects to https.

The configuration is defined as a template `volumes/reverse/nginx/conf/wordweaver.template` that is formatted with your domain name as defined in `.env`

## Certbot

*This is only required for deploying to production environments*

Certbot manages your SSL cert. We recommend using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). After securing your server ensuring Docker is available, and cloning your repo onto your server, do the following steps to set up automated renewals of your SSL cert.

1. Change the email and domain in `.env`
2. On your server, run `init-letsencrypt.sh` to get an SSL cert for your site
3. Spin up your WordWeaver by running `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`
