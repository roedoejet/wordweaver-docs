## GitHub Pages

WordWeaver is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages so that you can deploy your WordWeaver for free without having to maintain a server! To do so, you'll have to [make a fork of the WordWeaver repository](https://github.com/roedoejet/wordweaver/fork).

Once you do this, you will have to enable GitHub workflows as shown below:

---

<img src={require('@site/static/img/enable-workflow.png').default} />

---

Then, make sure that 'GitHub Pages' (the free service we are using to host your website) is set up to deploy from your 'gh-pages' branch. You can do this by going to Settings > Pages and then selecting "Branch: gh-pages" as the source as shown below:

---

<img src={require('@site/static/img/github-pages.png').default} />

---

You'll then have to change the [base key configuration](#base) to point to your fork: `https://<yourgitusername>.github.io/wordweaver`.

Then, whenever you push a change to your fork, your WordWeaver will also build and deploy to `https://<yourgitusername>.github.io/wordweaver`!
